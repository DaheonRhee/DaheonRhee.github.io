I am a first-year master’s student in department of political science at Yonsei University specializing in International Relations and International Political Economy with quantitative political analysis and text-as-data methods. My research explores the application of AI and computational methodologies, including LLMs, GNNs, and NLP, to questions in political science. I have double-majored in Economics, which has provided me with a strong foundation in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics, enabling me to systematically analyze international political and economic phenomena.

Substantively, I am interested in international security, great power politics, trade and finance, corporate lobbying, and African politics. I seek to integrate theoretical insights from IR and IPE with advanced computational tools to study political behavior and international economic relations at scale.
