I am a first-year master’s student in the Department of Political Science at Yonsei University, specializing in International Relations and International Political Economy, with a methodological focus on quantitative political analysis and text-as-data approaches.

My research explores the application of AI and computational methods—including large language models (LLMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and natural language processing (NLP)—to theoretical questions in International Relations.

Building on my undergraduate double major in Economics, I have developed a strong foundation in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics, which enables me to systematically analyze phenomena in international political economy.

Substantively, my research interests include international security, great power politics, international trade and finance, corporate lobbying, and stablecoins. I aim to integrate theoretical insights from IR and IPE with advanced computational tools to study political behavior and international economic relations at scale.
